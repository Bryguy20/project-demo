# Group Project: Task Calendar  

## Task Calendar 

The task calendar not only is just a simple calendar is so much more with a lot of feature like to see the weather, also to see all of your See all the events, todo for the current months and for the upcoming on the side of the calendar all in a list form of the brief description of all. What motivated us to make a task calendar is so we can help the students who are in school or even college to give them a time to get them organized with their busy school schedule  and keep them on track to not have any missing homework. This is for those types of students who get distracted very easily and help them get on track to see whatâ€™s due on what day. What we learned about creating this project was this trial and error process. Sometimes it might work or might not but it was mainly about working the codes and seeing what works and it turned out to be a great learning experience.
